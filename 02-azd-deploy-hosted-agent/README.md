# 07 — Deploy as a Foundry Hosted Agent (azd)

## Goal
Deploy the agent as a Foundry hosted agent using `azd` so it runs as a managed service.

## You will end with
- Infrastructure provisioned via `azd`
- Agent published as a hosted agent in Foundry
- A working endpoint you can call

## Prerequisites
- Completed `../06-tool-calling-and-otel`

## Proof (checklist)
- [ ] `azd up` completes successfully
- [ ] Hosted agent is visible in Foundry
- [ ] Endpoint invocation works and is traceable

## Next
Continue to `../08-entra-agent-id-conditional-access`.
