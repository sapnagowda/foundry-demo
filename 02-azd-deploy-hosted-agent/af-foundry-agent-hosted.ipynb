    "# Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents: Build + Deploy from Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **hosted agents** execution model (containerized, code-first) using the flow from the Microsoft Learn hosted agents page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Hosted Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the classic prompt-based agents where Azure runs your agent logic, **hosted agents** let you package your own code as a Docker container that Azure deploys and scales. This gives you full control over your agent's runtime, dependencies, and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key differences from classic agents:**\n",
    "- **Classic agents**: You define prompts/tools; Azure executes them in a managed runtime\n",
    "- **Hosted agents**: You write and containerize your own agent code; Azure deploys your container\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | What | Why |\n",
    "|------|------|-----|\n",
    "| 1) Local test | Run hosting adapter on `localhost:8088` | Validate your agent works before containerizing |\n",
    "| 2) Docker build | Create container image | Package your agent for deployment |\n",
    "| 3) ACR push | Push image to Azure Container Registry | Azure needs to pull your image from ACR |\n",
    "| 4) Capability host | Enable hosted agents on your account | One-time preview requirement |\n",
    "| 5) Create version | Register container as hosted agent | Tell Foundry about your agent image |\n",
    "| 6) Start deployment | Launch the hosted agent | Make it available for invocation |\n",
    "| 7) Invoke | Call via Responses API | Use your running agent |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**\n",
    "> - **Docker** installed and running\n",
    "> - **Azure CLI** (`az`) installed and logged in\n",
    "> - **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** created\n",
    "> - **Azure AI Foundry project** in North Central US (preview limitation)\n",
    "> - Appropriate **RBAC permissions** to assign roles"

    "## 0) Prerequisites & Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before running this notebook**, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment variables** set in a `.env` file (or exported):\n",
    "   - `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` or `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` — Your Foundry project endpoint URL\n",
    "   - `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` — The name of your deployed model (e.g., `gpt-4o`)\n",
    "   - `ACR_NAME` — Your Azure Container Registry name (without `.azurecr.io`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Azure CLI logged in**: Run `az login` if not already authenticated\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Docker running**: The Docker daemon must be started\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below loads these values. If any are missing, you'll need to set them before proceeding to the deployment steps."

    "**What to do:**\n",
    "1. **Create a new Foundry project in North Central US**, then run `create_version(...)` there.\n",
    "2. **Keep your ACR accessible** to that project. ACR can technically be in another region, but cross-region adds latency and potential policy friction — keeping ACR in North Central US (or nearby) is cleaner.\n",

    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- If `az account show` fails → Run `az login` first\n",
    "- If Docker fails → Start Docker Desktop or the Docker daemon\n",
    "- Wrong subscription? → Run `az account set --subscription <name-or-id>`\n",

    "## 5) Create a Dockerfile + Build the Image\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this step does:**\n",
    "1. Creates a `Dockerfile` that packages your agent app into a container\n",
    "2. Builds the Docker image locally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why containerize?**\n",
    "Azure AI Foundry hosted agents run as containers. Containerization ensures:\n",
    "- **Reproducibility** — Same environment locally and in Azure\n",
    "- **Isolation** — Your dependencies don't conflict with others\n",
    "- **Portability** — Deploy anywhere that runs containers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dockerfile breakdown:**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.11-slim          # Base image with Python\n",
    "WORKDIR /app                   # Set working directory\n",
    "COPY . /app                    # Copy your agent code\n",
    "RUN pip install ...            # Install dependencies\n",
    "EXPOSE 8088                    # Declare the port (documentation)\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"agent_app.py\"] # Start your agent server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image naming:**\n",
    "- `IMAGE_NAME` — The name of your image (default: `my-hosted-agent`)\n",
    "- `IMAGE_TAG` — Version tag (default: `v1`)\n",
    "- Full local reference: `my-hosted-agent:v1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Increment `IMAGE_TAG` (e.g., `v2`, `v3`) when you make changes to avoid caching issues."

    "## 6) Push Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this step does:**\n",
    "1. Configures the ACR connection using your `ACR_NAME`\n",
    "2. Logs into ACR using Azure CLI credentials\n",
    "3. Tags your local image with the ACR path\n",
    "4. Pushes the image to ACR\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ACR?**\n",
    "Azure AI Foundry can only pull container images from Azure Container Registry. When you create a hosted agent version, you provide an ACR image reference, and Foundry pulls from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image reference format:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "<acr-name>.azurecr.io/<image-name>:<tag>\n",
    "Example: myregistry.azurecr.io/my-hosted-agent:v1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- `ACR_NAME` environment variable set (just the registry name, not the full `.azurecr.io` URL)\n",
    "- You must have `AcrPush` role on the registry (or be an Owner/Contributor)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens behind the scenes:**\n",
    "1. `az acr login` — Gets a temporary Docker credential for your registry\n",
    "2. `docker tag` — Creates an alias pointing to ACR\n",

    "**Why is this needed?**\n",
    "When Foundry deploys your hosted agent, it needs to pull your container image from ACR. This requires:\n",
    "1. The Foundry project has a **system-assigned managed identity**\n",
    "2. That identity has **AcrPull** role on your ACR\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to find the Principal ID:**\n",
    "1. Go to Azure Portal → Your Foundry project resource\n",
    "2. Navigate to **Identity** → **System assigned**\n",
    "3. Copy the **Object (principal) ID**\n",
    "4. Set it as `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID` in your `.env`\n",

    "> This section refers to the Microsoft Foundry (new) portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note\n",
    "> Updating capability hosts is not supported. To modify a capability host, you must delete the existing one and recreate it with the new configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capability hosts are sub-resources that you define at both the **Foundry account** and **Foundry project** scopes. They specify where the Foundry Agent Service should store and process your agent data, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversation history (threads)\n",
    "- File uploads\n",
    "- Vector stores\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use capability hosts?\n",
    "Capability hosts allow you to bring your own Azure resources instead of using the default Microsoft-managed platform resources. This gives you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data sovereignty — keep all agent data within your Azure subscription\n",
    "- Security control — use your own storage accounts, databases, and search services\n",
    "- Compliance — meet specific regulatory or organizational requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do capability hosts work?\n",
    "Creating capability hosts is not required. If you don't create an **account-level and project-level** capability host, the Agent Service automatically uses Microsoft-managed Azure resources for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thread storage (conversation history, agent definitions)\n",
    "- File storage (uploaded documents)\n",
    "- Vector search (embeddings and retrieval)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Configuration hierarchy\n",
    "Capability hosts follow a hierarchy where more specific configurations override broader ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Service defaults (Microsoft-managed search and storage) — used when no capability host is configured\n",
    "- Account-level capability host — shared defaults for all projects under the account\n",
    "- Project-level capability host — overrides account-level and service defaults for that specific project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understand capability host constraints\n",
    "- One capability host per scope: each account and each project can only have one active capability host. Creating a second with a different name at the same scope will result in a `409 Conflict`.\n",
    "- Configuration updates are not supported: delete and recreate the capability host to change configuration.\n",

    "| `az cognitiveservices agent list-versions` | List all versions of an agent |\n",
    "| `az cognitiveservices agent update` | Update deployment configuration |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required parameters:**\n",
    "- `--account-name` — Your Foundry account name\n",
    "- `--project-name` — Your Foundry project name  \n",
    "- `--name` — Your hosted agent name\n",
    "- `--agent-version` — Which version to start (e.g., \"1\", \"2\")\n",

    "## Troubleshooting Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Container crashes with `ImportError`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptom:** Agent stuck in \"Starting\" with `InternalServerError`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root cause:** Wrong import in `agent_app.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# WRONG - will crash\n",
    "from azure.ai.agentserver.agentframework import from_agentframework\n",
    "\n",
    "# CORRECT - use underscores\n",
    "from azure.ai.agentserver.agentframework import from_agent_framework\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to fix:**\n",
    "1. Fix the import in `hosted_agent_app/agent_app.py`\n",
    "2. Rebuild Docker image with new tag (e.g., `v2`)\n",
    "3. Push to ACR\n",
    "4. Create new agent version with new image\n",
    "5. Start the new version\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `az cognitiveservices agent show` fails with `--agent-version`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptom:** `ERROR: unrecognized arguments: --agent-version`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root cause:** The `show` command doesn't accept `--agent-version`\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Has `--agent-version`? |\n",
    "|---------|------------------------|\n",
    "| `start` | ✅ Yes (required) |\n",
    "| `stop` | ✅ Yes (required) |\n",
    "| `show` | ❌ No |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct usage:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Show agent definition (no version param)\n",
    "az cognitiveservices agent show --account-name X --project-name Y --name Z\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start specific version (requires version)\n",
    "az cognitiveservices agent start --account-name X --project-name Y --name Z --agent-version 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Agent stuck in \"Starting\" status\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnostic steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check container locally first:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run --rm -e AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=\"...\" -e MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=\"...\" your-image:tag\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   If it crashes, check the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify ACR permissions:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   az role assignment list --scope $(az acr show -n YOUR_ACR --query id -o tsv) -o table\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Look for `AcrPull` role assigned to the Foundry project's managed identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Capability Host is enabled:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Account-level capability host(s)\n",
    "   az rest --method GET --url \"https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{account}/capabilityHosts?api-version=2025-06-01\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Project-level capability host(s)\n",
    "   az rest --method GET --url \"https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{account}/projects/{projectName}/capabilityHosts?api-version=2025-06-01\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify region:** Hosted agents are only available in **North Central US** (preview).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. How to check deployment status\n",
    "\n",
    "The `start` command is **idempotent** and returns current deployment status:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "status = json.loads(sh(\n",
    "    f\"az cognitiveservices agent start \"\n",
    "    f\"--account-name {FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT_NAME} \"\n",
    "    f\"--project-name {FOUNDRY_PROJECT_NAME} \"\n",
    "    f\"--name {HOSTED_AGENT_NAME} \"\n",
    "    f\"--agent-version {VERSION} \"\n",
    "    f\"-o json\"\n",
    "))\n",
    "print(\"Status:\", status.get(\"status\"))\n",
    "print(\"Container:\", status.get(\"container\", {}).get(\"status\"))\n",
    "print(\"Error:\", status.get(\"container\", {}).get(\"error_message\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Multiple agent versions\n",
    "\n",
    "When re-running this notebook, you may create multiple versions. To check existing agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# List all agents\n",
    "az cognitiveservices agent list --account-name X --project-name Y -o table\n",
    "\n",
    "# List versions of a specific agent\n",
    "az cognitiveservices agent list-versions --account-name X --project-name Y --name Z -o table\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Environment variables not found\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptom:** `ValueError: Missing required config...`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Ensure `.env` file has all required variables and reload:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "load_dotenv(override=True)  # override=True ensures fresh values\n",
