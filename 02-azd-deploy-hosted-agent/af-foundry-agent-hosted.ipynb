        "\n",
        "## What are Hosted Agents?\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike the classic prompt-based agents where Azure runs your agent logic, **hosted agents** let you package your own code as a Docker container that Azure deploys and scales. This gives you full control over your agent's runtime, dependencies, and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key differences from classic agents:**\n",
        "- **Classic agents**: You define prompts/tools; Azure executes them in a managed runtime\n",
        "- **Hosted agents**: You write and containerize your own agent code; Azure deploys your container\n",

        "| 3) ACR push | Push image to Azure Container Registry | Azure needs to pull your image from ACR |\n",
        "| 4) Capability host | Enable hosted agents on your account | One-time preview requirement |\n",
        "| 5) Create version | Register container as hosted agent | Tell Foundry about your agent image |\n",
        "| 6) Start deployment | Launch the hosted agent | Make it available for invocation |\n",
        "| 7) Invoke | Call via Responses API | Use your running agent |\n",
