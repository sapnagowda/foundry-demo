# 05 — Build the Agent (Microsoft Agent Framework)

## Goal
Implement a basic agent using Microsoft Agent Framework and confirm it can call your model deployment.

## You will end with
- A minimal Agent Framework agent you can run locally
- A stable agent “identity” in code (name + instructions) for later correlation

## Prerequisites
- Completed `../01-foundry-project-and-model-deployment`

## Proof (checklist)
- [ ] Local agent run returns a response from the model deployment
- [ ] Environment variables (.env) are read correctly

## Run (local)
- `python3 05-agent-build-with-agent-framework/src/00-first-agent.py`
- `python3 05-agent-build-with-agent-framework/src/00-first-agent-5-mini.py`

## Next
Continue to `../06-tool-calling-and-otel`.
