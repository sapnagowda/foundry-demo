This repo is a hands-on workshop for Microsoft Ignite 2025 announcements around Azure AI Foundry. You move from a local Agent Framework script to a governed hosted agent with grounded knowledge, end-to-end tracing, Entra Agent ID Conditional Access, Logic Apps MCP tooling behind APIM AI Gateway, and tool registration in the Foundry control plane.

## What you prove
- Local Agent Framework runs hit your Foundry or Azure OpenAI deployment using `.env` secrets.
- Hosted agent deployed with `azd` exposes a managed endpoint but keeps your code and dependencies.
- OpenTelemetry traces land in Foundry and Application Insights with a stable agent identity.
- Entra Agent ID plus Conditional Access block or allow agent execution in a measurable way.
- Foundry IQ knowledge base backed by Azure AI Search returns grounded answers with citations.
- Logic Apps Standard exposes workflows as MCP tools, including connector-backed actions, fronted by APIM AI Gateway policies.
- Foundry tool catalog registers the APIM-fronted tools, and Logic Apps can invoke the agent (A2A) to close the loop.

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with rights to create Foundry resources, Application Insights, Logic Apps Standard, API Management, and Azure AI Search.
- Python 3.10+, Azure CLI (`az`), Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) with the Azure AI Foundry extension.
- Ability to create a local `.env` (gitignored) with: `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`, `AZURE_OPENAI_REASONING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.

## Quick start
1. Create a virtual environment: `bash 00-environment-setup/scripts/bootstrap_venv.sh` (or `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`).
2. Install dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Copy the environment template: `cp 00-environment-setup/.env.example .env` and fill in your deployment values.
4. Smoke-test the local agent: `python 01-agent-framework-foundry-hosted-agents/01-af-standard-agent.py` (simple chat) or `python 01-agent-framework-foundry-hosted-agents/02-af-standard-agent-resoning.py` for the reasoning variant.
5. Keep tracing on your radar: `05-observability-otel-to-appinsights/` links Foundry to Application Insights before you add OTel instrumentation.

## Workshop path (folders)
| Order | Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 00 | `00-environment-setup/` | Tooling, Python env, `.env` template, verification script |
| 01 | `01-agent-framework-foundry-hosted-agents/` | Local Agent Framework examples and execution model comparison |
| 02 | `05-observability-otel-to-appinsights/` | Attach Application Insights to your Foundry project for tracing |
| 03 | `02-azd-deploy-hosted-agent/` | Deploy the agent as a hosted agent with `azd` |
| 04 | `05-entra-agent-id-ca/` | Entra Agent ID plus Conditional Access enforcement proof |
| 05 | `06-foundry-iq-grounding-with-ai-search/` | Azure AI Search plus Foundry IQ knowledge base grounding |
| 06 | `07-logic-apps-as-mcp-server/` | Logic Apps Standard as a remote MCP server |
| 07 | `08-connectors-as-mcp-tools/` | Connector-backed MCP tools exposed from Logic Apps |
| 08 | `09-apim-ai-gateway-mcp/` | APIM AI Gateway governance in front of MCP |
| 09 | `10-tool-catalog-registration-in-foundry/` | Register APIM-fronted tools in the Foundry catalog |
| 10 | `11-logic-apps-invoke-agent-a2a/` | Logic Apps workflow calls the agent (optionally chaining MCP calls) |
| Ref | `99-reference/` | Supporting PDFs and notes from Ignite and docs |

## How to use this repo
- Each folder README states the goal, prerequisites, and proof checklist; stay sequence-aligned so proofs stay meaningful.
- Keep `.env` local; scripts expect the Azure OpenAI or Foundry values listed above.
- When deploying or invoking hosted agents, align traces, APIM diagnostics, and Conditional Access results with the same `gen_ai.agent.id`.
- For MCP steps, start with `07-logic-apps-as-mcp-server/` before layering connectors and APIM guardrails.
