# 10 — Foundry IQ Grounding Proof

## Goal
Connect the IQ knowledge base to the agent and prove retrieval behavior in traces (including citations in the response).

## You will end with
- Agent configured with a knowledge retrieval tool (IQ/MCP-backed)
- A question that requires retrieval and yields citations/grounding output

## Prerequisites
- Completed `../04-azure-ai-search-and-foundry-iq`
- Completed `../09-observability-proof`

## Proof (checklist)
- [ ] Response includes citations/grounding output
- [ ] Trace shows retrieval tool calls/spans
- [ ] Search/retrieval spans are visible and correlated to the run

## Next
Continue to `../11-logic-apps-mcp-server`.
