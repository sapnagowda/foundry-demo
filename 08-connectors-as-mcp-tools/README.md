# 12 — Logic Apps Connectors to 3P Services (as MCP Tools)

## Goal
Create an MCP tool backed by a Logic Apps workflow that calls a managed connector (Slack/Jira/Salesforce/ServiceNow/etc.).

## You will end with
- A workflow that uses a connector action
- The workflow exposed as an MCP tool via the MCP server from step 11

## Prerequisites
- Completed `../11-logic-apps-mcp-server`

## Proof (checklist)
- [ ] MCP tool call triggers a Logic Apps run
- [ ] Connector action executes successfully
- [ ] The third-party system shows the corresponding activity

## Next
Continue to `../13-apim-ai-gateway-enterprise-safe-mcp`.
